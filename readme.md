Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL:
- pull the project from GIT repository

- install dependencies via composer install (you can also run composer update, if you want to update the existing dependencies, but I do not recommend that)
    $ php composer.phar install

- copy .env.example to the same directory and rename it to .env
    $ cp .env.example .env

- properly set the .env variables (assuming that the project will be run from homestead VM, it won't be necessary for now)

- set application key
    $ php artisan key:generate

- run migrations
    $ php artisan migrate

- seed the database
    $ php artisan db:seed

- if something goes wrong in the process, dump the autoload file
    $ php composer.phar dump-autoload
